   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to TBI's documentation!
===============================

**TBI** [#f1]_ is a programming language written in `Python 3.12 <https://python.org>`_, and is designed to limit the programmer's accessibility to 
common high-level features, some including *variables* and *functions*, forcing the developer to think more about how to preform common tasks with
limited memory and resources.

You can download **TBI** `here <https://github.com/TBI-project/TBI-project.github.io/raw/refs/heads/main/CODE/main.py>`_.

.. note::
   These python modules are required by TBI to function:
   
   -  os (built-in)
   -  random (built-in)
   -  time (built-in)
   -  py-term
   -  termcolor
   -  argparse

   | You can install them with:
   | ``pip install py-term termcolor argparse``

.. note::

   This project is under active development. Expect things to change.
