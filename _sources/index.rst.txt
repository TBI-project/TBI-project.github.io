===============================

**TBI** is a programming language written in `Python 3.12 <https://python.org>`_, and is designed to limit the programmer's accessibility to 
common high-level features, some including *variables* and *functions*, forcing the developer to think more about how to preform common tasks with
limited memory and resources.
